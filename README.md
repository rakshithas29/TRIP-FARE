## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Predict taxi fares using an XGBoost regression model  
- âœ… Input ride details like distance, duration, vendor, pickup hour, etc.  
- âœ… Explore ride data with interactive charts powered by Plotly  
- âœ… Visual analysis includes:
  - Fare vs Trip Distance
  - Trip Duration & Distance Distributions
  - Fare by Passenger Count
  - Trip Counts by Hour & Day of Week
  - Fare/km and Fare/min efficiency
  - Correlation Heatmap

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

The model was trained on NYC Yellow Taxi data and includes the following key fields:

- `pickup_datetime`, `dropoff_datetime`  
- `pickup_longitude`, `pickup_latitude`  
- `dropoff_longitude`, `dropoff_latitude`  
- `passenger_count`, `total_amount`, `RatecodeID`, `VendorID`

Feature engineering was applied to compute:

- Trip Distance (via Haversine formula)  
- Trip Duration (in minutes)  
- Pickup Hour, AM/PM, Day of Week  
- Weekend / Night Indicators  
- Fare per km & per minute
